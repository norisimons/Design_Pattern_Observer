# Design Patterns in C#

This repository is part of the (https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) project.

It contains C# examples for all classic GoF design patterns. Each pattern includes two examples:

 **Conceptual** examples show the internal structure of patterns with detailed comments.
 **RealWold** examples show how the patterns can be used in a real-world C# application.




Most examples are console apps built using .NET Core 2.0.

For the best experience, we recommend working with examples with these IDEs:

- [Visual Studio 2017 and newer](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) on Windows/Mac.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on any OS.
- [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) on any OS.
